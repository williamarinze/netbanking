## Built with
<b>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript</b> & <b>jQuery</b> used for front-end design.


<b>PHP7 & MySQL</b> used for back-end design.


<b>Oracle MySQL</b> has been used to create and host the database for the
internet banking website.


Other than the languages/tools mentioned above <b>no</b> other/external
libraries and/or web-page templates have been used, everything has been
coded from ground-up straight from scratch.

## How to build/use
Setup an environment which supports web development like <b>LAMP</b> on <b>Linux</b> systems OR install <b>WampServer/XAMPP</b> or anything similar on <b>Windows</b>.

Open a browser and test wether the setup works or not by visiting the home page. Type "localhost/home.php" as the URL in the browser to visit the home page.

However some important usernames and passwords are provided below :
* Username of admin is "admin" & password is "password123".
* Username of most of the customers is their "first_name" & password is their "first_name" followed by "123".
